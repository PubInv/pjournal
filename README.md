# pjournal

This is a system for easily using a phone or computer to upload a geolocated photo to create a spatial and temporal database. The database can then be viewed on a map.

The general purpose is to create a journalistic record that allows study or open source intelligence (OSINT).

## History

This is a fork of geotagtext, a geotagging tutorial app written by Robert L. Read, Diego Aspinwall, and Neil Martis.
Currently the only expected author of this fork is Robert L. Read


## Basic Idea

The goal of this project is to allow a group of people, perhaps in an emegency situation, to geotag locations
to be on a map. Like all Public Invention projects, it is free-libre open source.

Imagine using your phone to place a red tag on a flooded area, or where a person needs help, and
green tag on a road which is passable.

More generally, the ability to quickly upload a photo and have it reliably placed in time and space
with the "EXIF" data typically embedded by modern phones will allow a GUI that is a valuable journalastic
record of an event.

In particular, this response was made in response to the invasion of the Ukraine by Russia and
the potential need for making a journalistic record of that event.

## Basic Technology

The web page use the geolocation feature now built in to most browsers and accessible via JavaScript.

It uses free and open map technology.


## Goals

The goal is to further enhance and build on the existing application thereby developing an application user interface or a
public API which can used and incorporated into existing applications or a brand new project for example during natural disaster
or in applications like Free Little Libraries or Free Little Food Pantries.

Begun by Neil Martis and Rob Read. Improved by Neil Martis.
Written as a [tutorial](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/geotagtext-a-tutorial-a-free-geotagging-web-application-composed-of-free-tools-b42bcbcca202), then forked on Feb. 26th, 2022, the 3rd day of the invasion of Ukraine, by Robert L. Read.
